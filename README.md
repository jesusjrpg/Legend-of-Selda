# [Legend of Selda] - A Zelda-inspired 2D RPG Tech Demo 

![Gameplay Preview](Media/gameplay-demo.gif)

This project represents my **first comprehensive dive into Unity game development and C# programming**, taking inspiration from classic 2D action RPGs like The Legend of Zelda. Developed as a personal learning initiative, it served as a practical sandbox for implementing a wide array of core game mechanics and systems.

### Key Implemented Systems & Features

This demo showcases a robust set of interconnected systems, demonstrating foundational game development principles:

* **Dialogue System:** Branching dialogue trees with conditional progression.
* **Quest System:** Multi-stage quests with objective tracking and conditional triggers.
* **Categorized Inventory:** Management of items by type (e.g., weapons, consumables, key items).
* **RPG Leveling System:**
    * Player experience (XP) and level progression.
    * Stats influenced by level: HP, Strength, Defense, Attack Speed, and Luck.
* **Simple Combat System:**
    * Melee combat with damage calculation based on player stats.
    * Critical hit chance influenced by player's Luck stat.
* **Currency System:** In-game economy with gold acquisition and spending.
* **Basic Save/Load System:**
    * Utilizes `PlayerPrefs` for simple, persistent data storage.
    * Saves and loads player location, current map, money, and level.
* **Dynamic Music System:**
    * Area-based music changes with smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions.
* **Title Screen & Camera Management:** Custom title screen and dynamic camera following.
* **Puzzle & Progression Mechanics:** Implemented simple puzzles and environmental conditions that unlock new areas or reveal hidden objects.
* **Boss Battle Integration:** Designed and implemented a unique boss encounter.
* **Multiple Questlines:** Structured narrative progression through various quests.

### Learning & Development Focus

This project was pivotal in my journey, serving as a hands-on lab for:

* **C# Programming:** Solidifying object-oriented principles, data structures, and algorithms within a game context.
* **Unity Engine Mastery:** Gaining proficiency with Unity's component-based architecture, physics, UI, and animation systems.
* **Game Design Principles:** Understanding how to integrate various mechanics to create engaging gameplay loops.
* **Pixel Art & Animation:** While primarily using free assets, I gained experience creating and animating several custom 2D enemy sprites.
